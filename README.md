# FULL3 Setup (Frontend & Backend) - Powered by React, Hardhat, Tailwind, and Thirdweb

## INSTALLATION
- First Install as global dependency: `npm install -g full3`
- Initialize new project: `npx full3`

## About the Package
This is the app setup for a FULL STACK WEB3 project created by the FULL3 package. The FULL3 package is powered by the following technologies:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/): A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides the foundation for creating interactive and dynamic UI components in the frontend of the web3 project.

- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/): A popular development framework for Ethereum projects. Hardhat offers a set of powerful features for smart contract development and deployment, making it an essential tool for handling Ethereum interactions in the backend.

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): A utility-first CSS framework that provides a customizable set of CSS classes. Tailwind CSS enables efficient and rapid styling of components and user interfaces in the project's frontend.

- [Thirdweb](https://thirdweb.com/): A platform that offers services and tools for developing web3 applications. Thirdweb provides a Software Development Kit (SDK) and related packages, such as `@thirdweb-dev/react`, for specific functionalities, making it a valuable component in building web3 applications.

The FULL3 package simplifies the setup process for a full-stack web3 project. Users can easily initialize this project in their desired directory by running `npx full3` in the command line. The package provides both frontend and backend configurations, enabling users to seamlessly interact with Ethereum and Ethereum-like networks. It comes with essential dependencies and devDependencies for a smooth development experience and provides deployment scripts for various networks, making it a powerful tool for building decentralized applications.

## How to Run (Frontend)

- Sign up on the Thirdweb dashboard to achieve an API key (https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/settings/api-keys).
- Fill in the API KEY in the `main.jsx` clientId.
- Run using `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`.
- Read and write the contract methods.
- Don't forget to add your URL in allowance in the Thirdweb dashboard.

## Scripts (Frontend)

- **npm run dev**: Start the Vite development server.
- **npm run build**: Build the project using Vite.
- **npm run lint**: Run ESLint to check for code quality and enforce coding standards.
- **npm run preview**: Start a Vite server to preview the built project.

## How to Run (Backend)

- Create a `.env` file.
- Fill it with the same details as mentioned in `.env.example`.
- Uncomment the network and etherscan for the network you are going to use.
- Run the Hardhat project using `yarn` or `npm` command.

## Deployment Scripts

- **npm run deploy**: Deploy the project using the Hardhat framework to the Hardhat network.
- **npm run deploy-mumbai**: Deploy the project to the Mumbai network.
- **npm run deploy-mainnet**: Deploy the project to the Mainnet network.
- **npm run deploy-sepolia**: Deploy the project to the Sepolia network.
- **npm run deploy-bsc**: Deploy the project to the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) network.
- **npm run deploy-bsctestnet**: Deploy the project to the BSC Testnet.
- **npm run deploy-zkevm**: Deploy the project to the ZK-EVM network.
- **npm run deploy-zkevmtestnet**: Deploy the project to the ZK-EVM Testnet.
- **npm run deploy-optimism**: Deploy the project to the Optimism network.
- **npm run deploy-eth**: Deploy the project to the Ethereum (ETH) network.
- **npm run deploy-arbitrum**: Deploy the project to the Arbitrum network.

## Other Useful Commands

- **npm run node**: Start a local Hardhat node for development and testing purposes.
- **npm run help**: Get help on Hardhat commands and usage.
- **npm run networks**: List all available networks for deployment verification.
- **npm run coverage**: Generate code coverage reports for the project.

## Using Yarn

To use Yarn for running the commands, replace `npm run` with `yarn` in the above command list. For example:

- **yarn dev**: Start the Vite development server.
- **yarn deploy**: Deploy the project using the Hardhat framework to the Hardhat network.

For other commands like `yarn build`, `yarn lint`, `yarn preview`, `yarn node`, `yarn help`, `yarn networks`, and `yarn coverage`, simply replace `npm run` with `yarn` as well.

Remember to ensure that you have Yarn installed on your system before using Yarn commands.
